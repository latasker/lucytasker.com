# This is the data file for the /concerts page
#
# Entries are automatically split into upcoming and past events
# based on the `date` field.
#
# They are also automatically sorted by date
# so there's no need to order them by hand.
#
# The entry format is as follows:
#
# [[gigs]
#   # Gig dates must follow this format: YYYY-MM-DD, like 2024-01-31
#   # Dates are used for splitting the list into upcoming and past gigs,
#   # and for sorting those lists
#   # (upcoming gigs from sooner to later, past gigs from more recent to more distant)
#   # It's a required field.
#   date = 1970-01-01
#
#   # Gig time must be a quoted string
#   # It's not used in any way internally, can be anything like "21:00" or "9pm"
#   time = "9pm"
#
#   # Location is required, can be any quoted string
#   location = "USA, New York"
#
#   # Venue is optional, but it's a good idea to add it
#   venue = "Carnegie Hall"
#
#   # If the event is ticketed, you can provide a link for ticket booking
#   ticket_link = "https://tickets.example.com/events/my-event"
#
#   # Description is optional, but nice to have
#   description = '''
#     This is going to be the coolest concert ever.
